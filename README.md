# FoodManager

[Link](https://github.com/shavkunov/FoodManagerServer) to server repo. 

The goal of our app is optimizing the user's time by taking care of scheduling recipes.
For each recipe, we maintained step by step cooking progress and ingredients list.

A user can schedule his menu and create purchases list from the menu for convenient shopping.

The client contains navigation and creating queries to the server.
The server receives a query, obtain needed data from the database and send the response back.
